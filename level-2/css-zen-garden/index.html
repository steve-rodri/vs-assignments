      <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
      <p>
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
        tags, incompatible
        <abbr
          title="Document Object
        Model"
          >DOM</abbr
        >s, broken
        <abbr
          title="Cascading Style
        Sheets"
          >CSS</abbr
        >
        support, and abandoned browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
        <abbr title="">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="">WASP</abbr>, and the major
        browser creators.

        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
        lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
        the web.

      <h3>So What Is This About?</h3>
      <p>
        There is a continuing need to show the power of
        <abbr
          title="Cascading
        Style Sheets"
          >CSS</abbr
        >. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation.
        To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any
        one will load the style sheet into this very page. The
        <abbr title="">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has
        changed is the external
        <abbr
          title="Cascading Style
        Sheets"
          >CSS</abbr
        >
        file. Yes, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and
        total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
        can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating
        what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
        able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

    <section id="participation">
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
        page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills
        are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that
        even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use
        them as starting points. Please see the
        <abbr
          title="Cascading Style
        Sheets"
          >CSS</abbr
        >
        Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
        <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
        daunting at first if you've never worked this way before, but follow the
        listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you
        have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished
        work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file
        to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that
        file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
        download it and place it on our server.

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Why participate? For recognition, inspriation, and a resource we can all
        refer to showing people how amazing
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site
        serves as equal parts inspiration for those workig on the web today,
        learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
        techniques we can all look forward to.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="requirements">
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4
        should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks
        should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
        bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
        real requirement we have is that your
        <abbr
          title="Cascading Style
        Sheets"
          >CSS</abbr
        >
        validates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
        implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When
        sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results
        across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on
        the web these days -- especially when you factor in mobile --
        pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That's
        okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at
        least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run
        by over 90% of the population).
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that you submit orignial artwork. Please respect copyright laws.
        Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate
        unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the
        point of needing another garden-related design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
        copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission
        guidelines), but we ask you release your
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons
        license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from
        your work.
